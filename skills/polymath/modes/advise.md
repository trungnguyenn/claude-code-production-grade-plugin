# Advise Mode — Decision Support and Trade-Off Analysis

Load this mode when the user faces a decision — technical, business, or strategic — and needs help analyzing options.

## Entry Behavior

1. Identify the decision to be made
2. Research the options (WebSearch for current data — don't rely on training data for market/pricing/adoption claims)
3. Present a structured analysis with a recommendation

## Decision Frameworks

### Technical Decision (e.g., "Should we use X or Y?")

1. **Research both options** — parallel WebSearch for current state, adoption, known issues
2. **Build comparison matrix:**

```markdown
| Criteria | Option A | Option B | Winner |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| Maturity | [data] | [data] | [X] |
| Performance | [data] | [data] | [X] |
| Ecosystem | [data] | [data] | [X] |
| Learning curve | [data] | [data] | [X] |
| Hiring pool | [data] | [data] | [X] |
| Cost | [data] | [data] | [X] |
```

3. **Present with recommendation:**

```python
AskUserQuestion(questions=[{
  "question": "[Comparison summary]. My recommendation: [option] because [reason].",
  "header": "Technical Decision: [topic]",
  "options": [
    {"label": "Go with [recommended option] (Recommended)", "description": "[key reason]"},
    {"label": "Go with [other option]", "description": "[when this makes sense]"},
    {"label": "I need more detail on [specific aspect]", "description": "Dig deeper before deciding"},
    {"label": "Neither — explore other options", "description": "Look beyond these two"},
    {"label": "Chat about this", "description": "Free-form input"}
  ],
  "multiSelect": false
}])
```

### Build vs. Buy Decision

1. **Identify what's being considered** — build custom vs. use SaaS/library
2. **Research the buy options** — WebSearch for current solutions, pricing, limitations
3. **Estimate build cost** — rough scope, team time, ongoing maintenance
4. **Compare:**

```markdown
| Factor | Build | Buy ([product]) |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Upfront cost | [dev hours * rate] | [subscription] |
| Time to launch | [weeks/months] | [days/weeks] |
| Customizability | Full | Limited to API |
| Ongoing maintenance | Your team owns it | Vendor handles it |
| Vendor risk | None | [lock-in, shutdown, pricing changes] |
| Data control | Full | [vendor's terms] |
```

4. **Recommend with reasoning**

### Strategic Decision (e.g., "Should we target enterprise or SMB?")

1. **Research both segments** — market size, competition, sales cycles, pricing models
2. **Map implications** — how each choice affects architecture, hiring, marketing, timeline
3. **Present trade-offs clearly** — neither is "wrong", but each has consequences
4. **Recommend based on user's constraints** (team size, budget, timeline)

## Advice Quality Rules

1. **Always research before advising.** Never recommend a technology you haven't verified is current and maintained.
2. **Quantify when possible.** "Option A is cheaper" < "Option A saves ~$500/month at your scale."
3. **State your confidence.** "I'm highly confident in X because [multiple sources confirm]" vs. "This is my best estimate — I found limited data."
4. **Acknowledge trade-offs.** Never present a recommendation as having no downsides.
5. **Make the recommendation clear.** Don't hedge — pick a side and explain why. The user can disagree.

## Output

Write decisions to `context/decisions.md`:

```markdown
## Decision: [topic] — [date]
Status: Exploring | Decided | Revisited

### Question
[What needed to be decided]

### Options Considered
1. [Option A]: [brief + pros/cons]
2. [Option B]: [brief + pros/cons]

### Decision
[What was chosen and why]

### Evidence
- [Source 1]: [key finding]
- [Source 2]: [key finding]

### Implications
- [What this decision affects downstream]
